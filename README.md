## Introduction

I do some astrophotography, and it's a field where technique is very important.

However, I can never seem to remember all the settings...

So, I created this tool, EXIF_gallery, that allows me to store, analyze, and compare the data from my photos.

Built in PyQt5, I was able to explore SQL and HTML, as well as some more mathematical libraries.

Special thanks to Manon Seve for the logo and to Gabriel Akpo-Allavo, the best of spiritual guides.

It's not shown in the demo, but there are user-specific features such as inputting their own data or adding comments.

The goal in the future is to adapt EXIF_gallery for other types of photography.

## FEATURES
Each photo can store more data than a conventional image:
* EXIFs
* comments
* processing versions
* location of the shot

### Features for astrophoto
* number of shots + exposure times
* total exposure time calculated automatically
* Bortle level

#### Example
|ID|Image|Subject|Description|Author|Camera|Focal length|Mount|Aperture|ISO|NB lights|Exposure time|Total time|Place|Sky darkness|Moon Illumination|Processed with|Brut|Versions|Date|Comment|
